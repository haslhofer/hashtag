tion: This course will go under the hood and teach students how to design and evaluate high-level :
systems that use privacy PETS. After this course, students will be able to comprehend technical PET papers, 7

vite implementations based on them, and design eystems that leverage PETs, Tops covered il incude ] -
federated learning, split learning, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, cryptographic signatures,

public key technology, and more.

  

 Cross-Enterprise Statistics and Federated Learning: This practitioner course will give students an
understanding of how to use PyTorch and PySyft to perform cross-organizational analysis. Among the topics
covered, students will earn how to search for data that cannot be seen; clean and extract, transform, and load
(ETL) data without being able to analyze it; train models and perform statistical analysis using remote
execution tools; and work with models and data across multiple organizations simultaneously

 ML APPLICATIONS

 Federated Statistics and Learning on Web and Mobile: This course will cover how to build web and mobile Expanding automatic machine

apps that store data on devices running Android, iOS, and Reacts. Students will use PyTorch to perform translation to more languages

distributed database queries and train models using federated learning. By the end of the course, participants

will understand how to build an application with a distributed, on-device database; build an application while Part of Facebook's mission to bring the
