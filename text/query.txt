 ABSTRACT

 In this paper, we present GrokNet, a
deployed image recognition system for
commerce applications. GrokNet
leverages a multi-task learning
approach to train a single computer
vision trunk. We achieve a 2.1x
improvement in exact product match
accuracy when compared to the
previous state-of-the-art Facebook
product recognition system.

 ABSTRACT

 We propose a method for face de-
identification that enables fully
automatic video modification at high
frame rates. The goal is to maximally
decorrelate the identity, while having
 the perception (pose, illumination and
expression) fixed.

 ABSTRACT

 We present the first single-network
approach for 2D whole-body pose
estimation, which entails simultaneous
localization of body, face, hands, and
feet keypoints. Our method maintains
constant real-time performance
regardless of the number of people in
the image. Our approach considerably
improves upon OpenPose, the only
work so far capable of whole-body pose
estimation, both in terms of speed and
global accuracy.

 ABSTRACT

 We present a method for translating
music across musical instruments and
styles. This method is based on
unsupervised training of a multi-domain
wavenet autoencoder, with a shared
encoder and a domain-independent
latent space that is trained end-to-end
on waveforms,
